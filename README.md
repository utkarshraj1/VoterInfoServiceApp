# VoterInfoServiceApp
This app is a basic application in which an admin can login and perform CRUD applications.

The application is made on .NET MVC architecture and the Database connection has been done through Entity Framework Database first approach.

The Database file is not included in this solution. It should be made in database. There are two tables created : AdminUser and Voter. Since database connectivity was DB First EF approach. The properties created are of same name and same type of that of the column present in the two tables.

Thanks,
